# Environmental-Multi-Omics-Study
An assignment from my Birmingham Bioinformatics MSc. The task was to perform multi-omics analysis on daphnia samples drawn from different locations on a river - the organisms biological profiles providing insights into the state of the river. 
R code for different ML and data mining techniques are in seperate named files.
