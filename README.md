# Environmental-Multi-Omics-Study
An assignment from my Birmingham Bioinformatics MSc. The task was to perform multi-omics analysis on daphnia samples drawn from different locations on a river - the organisms biological profiles providing insights into the state of the river. Just a fortnight was given to complete the task from being inducted to completing and recording the final video presentation -  no mean feat when one has never seen the code for the relevant analysis methods before! 
R code for different ML and data mining techniques are in seperate named files. A full explanation of the work is provided in the associated powerpoint. 

K-mean clustering is used for the module detection present in the WGCNA script.
